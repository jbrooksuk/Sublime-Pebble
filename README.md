# Sublime Pebble [![Gittip](http://badgr.co/gittip/jbrooksuk.png)](https://www.gittip.com/jbrooksuk/)

Sublime Pebble aims to be the ultimate package to help developers write watch faces and applications for their [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) devices.

This is a work in progress, so there isn't much going on yet, but it will be improved upon!

# Installation
You can install via Package Control, just search "Pebble".

# Commands
Sublime Pebble uses the command palette to respond to these commands:

1. `build`
2. `clean`
3. `install`
4. `screenshot`
5. `ping`
6. `list`

You can also supply a custom command (without parameters at the moment).

# Completions
Currently there are only completions for the Foundation set of modules and a subset of the constant values.
